    fullReview: `<p>Here it is. My favorite film of all time. I don't really even know where to begin with this review as I can easily find praise to shower for every small piece of this film. The performances, the style, the writing, the cinematography, the score, the directing—I think you can make cases for why any of these could be the best part of the film. I've seen <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> around 10 times now and discover new and impressive things with each successive viewing. And with my initial gushing over this film out of the way, let's get into some specifics.</p>\n\n<p>First up: the style. As Wes Anderson's eighth directorial feature, he has had plenty of time to perfect what is now his immediately recognizable style of filmmaking. The colors are pastel, the cuts are quick, the costuming is impeccable, and the dialogue is witty. All of these combined deliver a one hundred minute experience that is airtight: there is no fat to this film and no room to ever be bored. Anderson's unique style consistently baffles me, and I always find myself asking the question of how he could come up with something as truly unique as <em>The Grand Budapest</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we have the dialogue, which in true Wes Anderson fashion is witty, dry, and fast-paced. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes, almost all dialogue deliveries are deadpan as if the actors were comically asked to not emote. This choice succeeds both in adding an element of humor to the film and elevating our interest in and attention to Monsieur Gustave H., who is anything but deadpan. It is hilariously quick-witted while also feeling as if it comes out of an old children's book. It feels very cute in that sense.</p>\n\n<p>Third, is our shining protagonist—a performance that is nothing short of electric. The verbose dialogue and Fiennes' acting result in some of the best monologues I know to exist in film. There are always multiple times when I watch this film that I wish my own speech could enter into such a flow state of eloquence as Monsieur Gustave H. And even beyond the charming formality of Fiennes' speech, this dialogue has the effect of conveying Gustave's sense of professionalism as he proves time and time again his unflinching belief in the importance of his profession. "You see? There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble insignificant—oh, fuck it."</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I want to mention in my enjoyment of this film is the attention to detail it exhibits. Much like the meticulous concierges it centers around, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> is attentive and thoughtful, making repeat viewings incredibly rewarding as new details are spotted. The following are some of my favorites:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Boy with Apple</em> is on the back of the dinner menu.</li>\n<li>All of the verse recitations are cut off mid-sentence until the very last one recited by Agatha when at last the story comes to a close.</li>\n<li>"Our mutual friend's predecessor" and Monsieur Jean steps back into frame.</li>\n<li>A Mendl's treat is served as the dessert for the dinner between The Author and Zero.</li>\n<li>The absence of L'air de Panache is the ultimate reason Gustave blows up at Zero, not the lack of shelter or disguises (certainly two more pressing concerns).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am sure that I will continue to find little details like this in my future viewings of this film (and best believe there will be plenty of future viewings). The amount of joy I derive from watching and re-watching this film makes me confident in my opinion that it is the best film of all time.</p>`,

    fullReview: `<p>I love this film (hence its placement in my top 5), but I don't think any future viewing will ever come close to how it made me feel the first time viewing it late one evening in December with one of my best friends. Perhaps that is the nature of films whose plots center around some narrative mystery: they aren't as exciting when you know exactly who did it and what happened. Yet although I'll never be able to re-experience the intrigue of <em>Prisoners</em> when I saw it first, there are still plenty of things to praise whose merit remains regardless of the viewing count. So let's start there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hugh Jackman's performance:</strong> The "where is my daughter" scene has been memed to death and of course draws the most attention, but where I felt he excelled were in some of the quieter moments. The first scene where Keller Dover (Jackman) meets Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) felt so devastating as Dover visibly battles between his attempts at maintaining a respectful dialogue and his feelings of outrage and terror. He portrays a very complicated and angry man who pushes the line on what is morally acceptable all while maintaining the audience's sympathies. Even with the impressive writing, the dichotomy of Dover's questionable actions and his justifiability with the viewer could easily be a challenge too daunting for lesser actors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Themes of moral ambiguity:</strong> <em>Prisoners</em> takes no stance on the hard line between right and wrong and in doing so causes reflection in the mind of its viewers. Like any substantially compelling film, the question of "what would I do in their situation" takes root as our protagonist is confronted with an impossible situation. For some, this question manifests as a "How much do you love your family?" and yet for others it could take the form of "Do you value your humanity?" I applaud any film that can turn my critical gaze inwards and <em>Prisoners</em> effectively does so with such an intriguing and difficult premise.</p>\n\n<p>But easily the standout part of the film was exactly what cannot be replicated upon subsequent viewings. The mystery at its center was able to take the above elements and craft a thrilling whodunit that poses interesting questions, features wonderful performances, and never ever lets go of the viewers' attention. Genuinely one of the quickest two and a half hours I have ever experienced as I was dying to uncover the mystery and grapple with its implications. I won't get into specifics for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but between serious red herrings and small, rewarding details, <em>Prisoners</em> is a masterclass in building suspense and crafting a gripping mystery. This film is one of my go-to's when friends ask for film recs.</p>`,

    fullReview: "<p>There is a reason hundreds of video essays exist dissecting the extremely fast-paced and intelligent dialogue of <em>The Social Network</em>. It is apparent as soon as we're launched into the bar with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) that the unfolding film will require a viewer's utmost attention to appreciate the blink-and-you'll-miss-it speed and wittiness of Aaron Sorkin's Oscar-winning screenplay. I can say whole-heartedly that I agree with both the hype and the awards the film has received: this is my favorite screenplay of all time. And this time around, one of the most impressive feats I took care to notice was how well the writing juggles dialogue, juggles storylines, and juggles characters.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these three is easiest to notice, and while the opening scene is perhaps the best example, we can find instances scattered throughout the entire film. Characters begin by discussing a single topic. Soon after, however, one of them deviates suddenly to another discussion. Sometimes their partner catches on and the topics change entirely, but more often, the second speaker lingers in the past of the conversation and the characters almost begin to alternate with each line of dialogue between topics until, yet again, they suddenly deviate. While this might sound like a jumbled mess with no concrete examples to compare it to, it somehow works within the context of the film. This style of writing tightly grabs the viewer's attention (as close attention is required to keep up) and solidifies our understanding of the intelligence of our characters, as only quick minds can drive such witty conversations.</p>\n\n<p>The juggling of storylines was what I was most impressed with in my most recent viewing. The story obviously centers around the founding of Facebook, but instead of hitting the expected beats of what a traditional Mark Zuckerberg biopic would look like, <em>The Social Network</em> takes a different approach by telling the story from the point of view of two future and separate lawsuits concerning controversies of the network's founding. They both focus on Mark and his coming to invent Facebook, but the Winklevoss twins battling IP theft and Eduardo Saverin dealing with his stock dilution are two totally separate stories. Yet somehow, even with consistently bouncing between four different points in time (two cases and their past and present instances), not once did I find myself lost or confused. The film maintains a clear narrative that manages to merge all four points in time into one cohesive story of the founding of Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the juggling of characters, while not as universally praised as the witty dialogue, gives the events of the film a great deal of purpose. Perhaps even the most engaging dialogue ever written has the potential to fall flat if it is impossible to care about those delivering it. Thankfully, this is not a problem that <em>The Social Network</em> has. All of the major characters (with the exception of Sean Parker) have motives that are understandable and very human. Eduardo wants to impress his father and be recognized for his contributions to the launch of the platform. The Winklevoss twins want credit for an idea that (let's be honest) was kind of theirs from the beginning. And even Mark Zuckerberg, a public figure who has been scrutinized relentlessly as an unfeeling techno-exploiter, was humanized as an intelligent, insecure, ambitious kid who just wanted to impress a girl. In this way, the film emotionally grounds its characters with relatable motives, allowing its rapid-fire dialogue and interweaving narrative to shine as some of the best in the industry.</p>",

    fullReview: `<p>Okay okay I agree Christoph Waltz gives undeniably one of the greatest performances of all time—both charmingly loquacious and absolutely terrifying. Oscar well-deserved. Brad Pitt's performance, however, does not get as much attention as it deserves. He is charming, funny, Southern, nonchalant, and intimidating. He elicits a laugh just as easily as he does a "hell yeah" or a "bruuuutallll." Just a very cool and insane protagonist that I feel very strongly about.</p>\n\n<p>Other things I love about this one are the strange choices to include weird details. Only some characters get title cards, Samuel L. Jackson narrates random and disconnected scenes, and for some reason Hugo Stiglitz is the only character that receives an electric guitar fanfare. And while these choices are, for lack of a more nuanced description, quite weird, <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> feels as if it has such a distinct personality in part because of odd choices like these.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the overall story, obviously the dialogue is a step above everything else in this film (with the possible exception of Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa). The best examples of Tarantino's suspense-building writing are on full display in the opening interrogation scene and the bar scene; despite their similarities (high-stakes conversations that ultimately result in exploding action), both remain unique and equally engaging. Likewise, the audacity to alter significant historical events, making for an unpredictable ending, was a bold writing choice that now I couldn't imagine being executed any differently. There are only a handful of scenes throughout the entirety of the film, and yet it manages to tell a very complete story through the careful selection of scene inclusions and the methodical dialogue.</p>`,

    fullReview: "<p>What would you do if you knew you were going to die in 6 months? This is the question that Akira Kurosawa's 1952 film <em>Ikiru</em> asks of the viewer—one its protagonist finds himself grappling with after a stomach cancer diagnosis. Realizing he has left behind no real legacy, public affairs director Kanji Watanabe decides to make an impact by coordinating an effort to reconstruct a local park.</p>\n\n<p>Replicated countless times since (<em>Breaking Bad, The Fault in Our Stars</em>, etc.), the theme of finding purpose in the face of death is a concept not exactly foreign to the screen. But what is most emotionally compelling is how the film trades the scope and existentialism of discovering meaning in mortality with a resonant and actionable message about being greedy for the enjoyment of life. It is impossible to watch the film without being pestered by the question of \"What would I do in Watanabe's situation?\" and luckily for the audience, a solution is offered. For Watanabe, this solution comes in the form of emulating a young ex-employee of his office, Toyo Odagiri. As Watanabe is drawn to the young woman's constant laughter and unbridled authenticity, the audience considers what is actually important in the grand scheme of things. Despite Watanabe's relative \"success\" in his career, it is the unemployed yet joyous Odagiri who is truly living the more valuable life. And just as she has affected him, Watanabe seeks to make an impact in the lives of others.</p>\n\n<p>What <em>Ikiru</em> does best is turning the deeply personal story of a man grappling for meaning onto its audience. And if the first half of the film sets up for its viewer this idea of exhibiting a greediness for life, the second half depicts the potential of its effects. <strong>(Spoiler alert)</strong> Abruptly in the middle, the film cuts to seven months in the future—Watanabe has died, the park has been built, and his funeral is underway. It is through discussions and flashbacks of Watanabe's peers (<em>12 Angry Men</em>-style) that we piece together the events of the past months and find out that Watanabe was indeed successful in his mission. Here, the effects of Watanabe's transition are separated into three camps, each with their own lesson associated.</p>\n\n<p>It is in Watanabe's coworkers where <em>Ikiru</em> instructs that a greediness for life will not be understood by all. Indeed, in many cases, those who do not understand will seek to discredit, as the other city officials brush aside the effort put forth by Watanabe. The film instructs us of the personal nature of our own search for meaning and how fulfillment should not (and perhaps cannot) come from the recognition of others. Yet that is not to say it won't do external good. In the second camp are the women of the neighborhood where the park was built. Moved by his death and in appreciation of his effort, they attend the funeral with quiet respect and profound understanding of the time and effort Watanabe poured into their community. They show us that while our own search for meaning will not be understood by all, there are still those who will be deeply impacted by the example we set.</p>\n\n<p>In the final camp, and perhaps most importantly, is Watanabe himself, who, via flashback, is shown spending his final few moments singing <em>Life is Brief</em> as he sits on a swing in his newly built park. Earlier in the film, this exact song served as the culminating moment of Watanabe's despair. He drunkenly sings it alone in a bar as he realizes he hadn't followed the song's advice to live life to the fullest. Yet now, at the very end of his life, the song's meaning changes—as against all odds, he was able to follow its teachings and make an impact. He contentedly sits alone with this realization, conveying to the viewer that the most important effect of the search for meaning is felt personally. It's not the newly built park that is Watanabe's legacy; it's his success in making an impact ultimately on himself.</p>\n\n<p>Conveying this sentiment is my favorite moment in the film, which occurs as Watanabe is physically threatened by competing interests who do not want to see the park built. They ask, \"What's the matter? Don't you value your life?\" Watanabe only smiles to himself, and we, the audience, know it's because, at last, he finally does.</p>",

    fullReview: "<p>Bong Joon Ho's <em>Mickey 17</em> follows Mickey Barnes (Robert Pattinson), who joins a space colony as an \"Expendable,\" a disposable worker who gets cloned and reprinted every time he dies for research purposes. Hilarity ensues when an accidental Mickey 18 is printed before Mickey 17 has a chance to die. While the film's premise and execution are truly quite bizarre, it retains a sense of self-awareness and relishes in its unorthodoxy—I'm looking at you, Mark Ruffalo's teeth. Yet despite the film's bold choices and genuinely funny performances, it ultimately is unable to maintain the absurdity of its first act and falls into many of the expected beats of modern sci-fi action films.</p>\n\n<p>Let's start with what the film does well. Luckily, we need not look far, as its strengths are apparent from the very beginning. Robert Pattinson narrates the 30-minute opening, and through a combination of his Looney Tunes-esque performance and the positioning of a regular guy in a wildly absurd situation, we cannot help but like our protagonist. From the introduction of the premise, the viewer is drawn in and left pondering (as many side characters ask of Mickey) how it must feel to die over and over again. Our curiosity surrounding Mickey's job makes us view death through his eyes—via a lens of humor and indifference. The film moves on to describe Mickey's preceding circumstances and, as any sci-fi film must, world-build. Yet while narration and heavy exposition are usually tools to be frowned upon, here they work, as each scene adds another detail depicting how such a regular guy could be caught up in such a weird situation. In this way, the film successfully accomplishes three major things with its opening—endearing us to its protagonist, making us question how we would respond in his situation, and getting us invested in the sci-fi setting behind the premise. Genuinely a fun and engaging time.</p>\n\n<p>Yet beyond the title card, the film loses steam. While perfectly set up to do some serious (and at times comedic) exploration of individuality despite replication and indifference in the face of death, <em>Mickey 17</em> sacrifices these themes to become almost a screwball comedy featuring two Pattinsons and a roster of underdeveloped and only somewhat compelling side characters. What could have been an absurdist comedy with something to say about the human condition becomes a formulaic action film following the all-too-familiar pattern of action blockbusters—defeating some villain by achieving some goal and saving the day. On top of this, many subplots that raised excellent questions about one's relationship to their own clone (sharing romantic partners, sacrificing oneself for oneself) were pushed aside in favor of the main plot and only haphazardly tied up as seeming afterthoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, <em>Mickey 17</em> is a very fun watch but fails to be anything more than that. Perhaps the bar was set too high given the inevitability of comparisons to its masterpiece of a predecessor, <em>Parasite</em>, and Bong Joon Ho in the director's chair wasn't enough to save the film at the box office. However, the film has plenty of merit in its lead performance, its setting, and its jokes, which admittedly had me laughing pretty hard in theaters.</p>",

    fullReview: "<p>I've had this film on my radar for quite some time as one of the most classic and beloved Westerns of all time. The final straw pushing me to watch it came when I was vehemently urged to see it by a Texas country store cashier who looked like he would fit right in with the Hole in the Wall Gang. So two nights later, I sat down in the living room with my parents and got to watching.</p>\n\n<p>There is something very interesting about seeing older movies in that it is impossible to replicate the context of viewing the film when it first came out in theaters. With over fifty years since its release, <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> didn't have the impact on me quite like it did on someone growing up in the '60s on tales of the Wild West and with knowledge of the major stars of the day. So I approach this review with no bias from its popularity at the time of release and no major personal passion for its genre. I view it from the lens of someone with a general interest in film as a whole and my own knowledge that this is indeed heralded as a classic of its time.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even with my self-proclaimed objectivity, the film impressed me not with high-stakes gunslinging or outrageous lawlessness but with its core character dynamics. As the title suggests, the film follows two outlaws—Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid—and their various escapades after a train robbery gone wrong. And if ever the friendship between two characters in a buddy western film was apparent, it is this one. Cassidy and Sundance, come hell or high water, never fail to be cracking jokes at one another's expense with wit and dialogue as sharp as Sundance's shooting skills (the waterfall scene being the best example). It's quite possible their dynamic was the motivating example behind the phrase \"maybe the real destination was the friends we made along the way.\"</p>\n\n<p>And while their friendship serves as the heart of the film, it is complemented by some stellar cinematography. The first scene had me excited that the rest of the film would remain in the opening, beautiful yellow-tinted black and white. Yet even though it transitioned a few minutes later, I remained impressed by the visual spectacle the film put on. It reveled in the natural beauty of the western United States that made me, at multiple times, question whether particular shots were paintings. Perhaps westerns have an unfair advantage in this department, as the scenery of the wild is unanimously deemed beautiful compared to certain cityscapes and indoor scenery. Yet <em>Butch Cassidy</em> masterfully used this advantage to its full capacity, resulting in a film whose technically simple shots were always gorgeous to look at.</p>\n\n<p>The story itself was pleasantly simple, localizing around a small segment in the careers of these two outlaws. Nothing about the story particularly blew me away, but its limited scope enabled the film to hone in on its strengths and not spend self-aggrandizing time on details unimportant to the core narrative. In short, I found the film simple, beautiful, and heartwarmingly friendly. And although it does not rank among my favorites, I can understand why some ascribe this to be a classic.</p>",

    fullReview: "<p><em>Heat</em> is director Michael Mann's telling of a cat-and-mouse game between an LAPD officer (Al Pacino) and a career criminal (Robert De Niro) as one tails the other following a series of heists. Despite minor grievances of mine, the film stood out to me for overcoming one major problem (something I've personally struggled with in many films of similar duration): it made a three-hour runtime feel half that length. Supported both by high-octane action set pieces that have become the industry standard and two actors generally considered to be some of the greatest of all time, the film is engaging, exciting, and even funny at times.</p>\n\n<p>But let's get my nitpicks out of the way. First off, for a film that relies quite a bit on the action from a few high-intensity scenes, the blocking was oftentimes hard to follow. The first heist and even the LA bank heist that is so widely praised were quite difficult to calibrate. With so many moving pieces and many characters whose fates we care about, it's paramount that the audience does not feel lost in the sauce with such frequent camera movements and a lack of clarity. I unfortunately found myself in this boat, despite how nerve-racking and adrenaline-pumping these scenes still managed to be.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly (and much less importantly), the meaning of the title was a little too on the nose. There were frankly too many times where the \"heat coming around the corner\" was referenced, really beating the viewer over the head with the title card references. I did appreciate the foreshadowing of the ending that the meaning conveyed but merely felt it could have been done a little more subtly. McCauley's (De Niro's) choice at the end seemed spoiled as a result.</p>\n\n<p>But in regards to my praise, which definitely dominated my opinion of the film, I'm struggling to find something to say that hasn't already been said. I found Al Pacino's performance to be particularly compelling, and his shouting interjections at random times were very funny to me. I applaud the film's resistance to falling into the typical tropes of heist films (building a team, planning in a warehouse, etc.), and despite my minor blocking issues, found the action to definitely be one of the peaks of the film. It seems like Michael Mann has a definitive type of film he likes to direct—and in this case, that is absolutely a compliment.</p>",

    fullReview: "<p>The opinion that <em>The Godfather</em> trilogy (and in particular the first and second films) is overrated has become increasingly popular among younger film enthusiasts. This perspective has even made its way into mainstream media commentary, such as in <em>The White Lotus</em> and <em>Barbie</em>. And while I usually push back against the habit of disliking something purely because it's widely praised, I have to admit: I think <em>The Godfather Part II</em> is overrated.</p>\n\n<p>My biggest issue lies in the film's identity crisis—it can't decide whether it wants to be a sequel or a prequel. I genuinely enjoyed Robert De Niro's portrayal of a young Vito Corleone, and I was excited to see more of this iconic character's backstory. But ultimately, these flashbacks felt only loosely tied to Michael's arc in the present day. If there had been stronger thematic or plot-specific links between the timelines, I could understand the runtime, but as is, the prequel material felt like a separate (and potentially stronger) film awkwardly spliced into another one.</p>\n\n<p>Another sticking point is how closely the film mirrors the original. Once again, we get a handful of mostly forgettable antagonists, a wave of attempted hits against the Corleone family, and Michael (Al Pacino) emerging victorious but more isolated than ever. While <em>The Godfather Part II</em> aims to explore the emotional toll of Michael's rise, the themes of power, corruption, and familial decay are largely retreaded from the first film—only now stretched across a bloated 3.5 hours. The few things the film does differently (like the Vito flashbacks) don't feel cohesively integrated, and I was left wondering what exactly justified the film's legendary reputation.</p>\n\n<p>Still, this isn't to say I didn't find parts of the film worthwhile. The courtroom drama in the middle was surprisingly compelling, particularly the paranoia around informants and how that tension rippled through Michael's inner circle. And despite my complaints about the flashbacks, I have to admit that my favorite moment in the entire film was the final scene—a flashback to a Corleone family dinner before the events of the first film. It was a beautifully executed emotional beat, especially in how it reframed Fredo's betrayal and death. Knowing that Fredo was the only one who supported Michael's decision to join the Marines made his fate all the more tragic.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Godfather Part II</em> is not a bad film. It's well-acted, beautifully shot, and contains a handful of standout moments. But I can't help but feel like its critical pedestal is more about legacy than merit. In my eyes, it's a good movie—not a masterpiece.</p>",

I think it was very appropriate that a movie that prompts so much self-reflection on the destiny of romantic relationships was brought up then. This is certainly a film that causes some Friday-night-staying-up-till-2-am conversations with oneself lying in bed thinking about the future.</p>\n\n<p>At the center of the story are Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo)—two childhood sweethearts who are separated when the former immigrates with her family to Canada and subsequently the US. The two manage to reconnect twice more in their future: first in their early twenties where they attempt a long-distance relationship and second in their mid-thirties after Nora has been married to another (John Magaro) for seven years. Like <em>La La Land</em> and <em>Lost In Translation</em>, <em>Past Lives</em> similarly has you yearning throughout the film that our two protagonists end up together. And also like <em>La La Land</em> and <em>Lost In Translation</em>, the film ends tragically with our lovers unable to be together and going their separate paths.</p>\n\n<p>The film does a wonderful job of endearing us to our protagonists as a couple. Of course the audience is biased since we spend all of the film watching them interact. However, the charming awkwardness of trying out a relationship and feeling so strongly for the other person while not being able to say exactly the right things is on full display from the get-go. Their conversations throughout the film were filled with uncomfortable pauses and nervous smiles, and their falling in love felt so authentic because of it.</p>\n\n<p>Building off that authenticity, what I loved the most about <em>Past Lives</em> was its complicated realism. Yes, the long-lost lovers reconnecting every decade is something you'll rarely encounter in real life, but what I found particularly genuine was the reason behind their ultimate separation. Unlike in <em>La La Land</em> and <em>Lost In Translation</em>, the two aren't driven apart by their ambitions for their respective careers or because of age-gap incompatibility. Both Nora and Hae Sung were seemingly perfect for each other, which made their ultimate fate all the more tragic: it didn't work out because, well, it didn't work out. The unexplained reasons, while infinitely more frustrating, I believe reflect much more about human love and relationships. We're not neatly-drawn people in a neatly-drawn world, and sometimes it's just impossible to explain why things panned out the way they did.</p>\n\n<p>But apart from its thematic authenticity, the film did a wonderful job of making a compelling story with such a small cast of characters; it really only had three of them the whole time. And even Arthur, who the audience is set up to resent as the \"evil white husband\" who gets in the way of true love, elicited strong emotion from me as someone in love who fears his partner might love another. My favorite scene (while maybe a bit too meta) was his discussion with Nora where he expresses this fear about two-thirds of the way through the film. Just an all-around very beautifully written film. And I'll end the review by calling attention to the funniest part of the film—the only point where I would say the film wasn't beautifully written. Enjoy some background dialogue of Hae Sung's college peers that sounds straight out of an English Language Textbook:</p>\n\n<p>\"Have you done your homework?\" \"I haven't.\" \"You have to do it for graduation.\" \"I got under academic probation last semester.\" \"Let me see your homework.\" \"Maybe next time.\" \"What's your plan for the weekend?\" \"Playing games.\"</p>",

    fullReview: "<p>There is a feeling I experience when watching certain films that I'm sure is quite common among cinephiles. A film will make artistic choices whose meaning might go over my head upon my initial viewing. But because the movie is so well-praised, I jump to the conclusion that those choices—although beyond my understanding—make the film compelling. I praise the movie even though I really don't comprehend what I am praising. This review is a concerted effort to fix that.</p>\n\n<p>If you've seen this film, you probably know exactly what I'm talking about. <em>The Tree of Life</em> follows a grown man's (Sean Penn) recollection of his upbringing and the conflicting influences that both his father (Brad Pitt) and his mother (Jessica Chastain) have on him. But beyond that seemingly normal premise, the film is interspersed—particularly at the beginning and the end—with beautiful scenes of nature that appear to have no relation to the central story. Amidst explosions of huge suns and explorations of golden caverns, the film even features a short scene of a dinosaur's life being spared by another dinosaur (I'm coming to realize this eccentricity is a norm for director Terrence Malick).</p>\n\n<p>As alluded to before, I can't say that I fully \"got\" the inclusions of these scenes. I'm sure there are some video essays out there arguing how they symbolize the fragility of life or motivate existentialist thought; I just found the central human-based story to be largely separate and much more compelling. I don't think I'd go so far as to say I would remove them from the final cut if I could: I respect the bold choices and the scenes are some of the most beautiful shots probably ever put to film. They just did not stir me as emotionally as I believe was their intent.</p>\n\n<p>But enough with what didn't work perfectly for me. Let's talk about what did. If <em>Boyhood</em> (2014) follows the life of a boy changing as he grows up, then <em>The Tree of Life</em> is much more about a man remembering the changes he went through as a boy growing up. Jack's upbringing is ethereal and secondhand—as if we're peering through a man's mind to take a look at some of his most defining childhood experiences. There is a flow from scene to scene as if Jack is guiding us through his memories, as one would do reliving past experiences through a daydream. When one memory is finished being re-lived, it spurs the recollection of another—sometimes a glimpse and sometimes a core memory—the authenticity of which is aided by the intentionally unsteady camera work. These transitions, with their emphasis on movement, never feel jarring and are what I'd imagine reading someone's mind would actually be like.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I think I've decided that I am in awe of the way Terrence Malick films look. There is an emphasis on natural lighting in this film that makes each shot feel simple and beautiful. I've said nothing of the character work or in praise of the plot, but part of the reason I feel these were executed well was because of the way they interact with the film's cinematography. They all work to convey the messiness that is inseparable from parenting, growing up, and changing in general.</p>",

    fullReview: `<p>Okay here we go. This one was pretty divisive to say the least. On the one hand, the virality of the film and its mainstream appeal skyrocketed the box office numbers, making it hard to argue against the fact that this movie was quite popular. On the other hand, there are plenty of voices out there labeling this the "brain-rot" of modern film and expressing frustration over the obnoxious audience participation in cinemas. But I know y'all are here for my opinion, so here it is.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I had a very good time. The amount of fun that Jack Black and Jason Momoa are clearly having on screen translated very well for me. Absolutely the film was a goofy mess with some frankly off-putting blends of reality and CGI, but I cannot deny that its stupidity was part of its charm. Jack Black simultaneously doesn't take anything seriously and gives this role his all—a dedication I salute. I can tell from watching this film (and really any video of him that exists on the internet) that Jack Black would be a very fun person to know in real life.</p>\n\n<p>A big part of me was tempted to hate the film going into it. After all, <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> has all the ingredients necessary to piss off pretentious film bros—it's a goofy blockbuster about an existing IP using corny jokes and big names to draw in audiences. But despite my expectations, the film was surprisingly self-aware. Leaning into the silliness made for an absolutely absurd, but in many ways charming, experience.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I can't claim the film is any masterpiece. I won't really remember—and indeed have already forgotten—all of the side characters beyond our two main actors. And even with the consistent swinging for the fences of many of the film's jokes, there were plenty of moments that fell very flat for me. But at the end of the day, I have to remember that I'm not the target audience, and the film probably worked for a lot of kids who are growing/grew up with the game. I'm glad that I got a small something out of the film, and seeing Jack Black on the big screen is always a pleasure.</p>`,

    fullReview: `<p>This film reminded me of how much I love going to see new and well-made films in the theaters. I definitely am finding myself hopping on the hype train for <em>Sinners</em>, but I believe there were a lot of good things about this one that made it deserve the hype it received. Ryan Coogler's success story is an inspiration to any aspiring filmmaker (not referring to myself: I have no interest in making films), and it was wonderful to see the immediate success he's encountered after releasing his best film yet.</p>\n\n<p>My go-to complaint when I dislike horror films is that the protagonists are forgettable. For most horror, this complaint tends to be pretty valid, as the main selling point of the film is the villain/slasher/demonic force and not their victims. As a result, it is tough to have any emotional reaction (other than disgust if the death is brutal) when major characters are slaughtered. That is not a problem that <em>Sinners</em> encounters. This stems primarily from the choice to spend the first almost half of the film assembling and developing our cast of characters. It is indeed almost exactly at the hour and fifteen minute mark of the two-and-a-half-hour film that the vampires are even introduced. With lesser films, audiences could easily be turned off by this slow start to a supposedly terrifying film. But because <em>Sinners</em> characters are so well-crafted and just plain interesting, it somehow avoids evoking this response.</p>\n\n<p>In writing the above paragraph, however, I've come to realize that <em>Sinners</em> isn't just a typical horror film and indeed is not even just a horror film. Somehow, it manages to bridge genre gaps, resulting in something of a Horror/Period Piece/Musical with racial commentary. And because of the skillful combination of these four seemingly incompatible genres, <em>Sinners</em> is able to create a film that is genuinely unique and unlike any others I've seen before. Between the refreshing take on the vampire myth and musical numbers that are easily the best scenes in the film (you know the one I'm talking about), <em>Sinners</em> enters the ranks not only as a successful genre-hybrid film but as a successful film individually in each of these categories.</p>\n\n<p>Transitioning to nitpicks, there were very minor plot points that didn't add up for me—vampires keeping promises and the KKK involvement—but given the story is about summoning demons with the power of music, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and cut the film some slack in these areas. While none of the performances particularly blew me away, I was impressed with the film's ability to ensure there was no confusion on who was who of the Michael B. Jordan twins. Smoke and Stack were distinct enough with their personalities, relationships, and wardrobes that this was not a problem.</p>\n\n<p>In case this wasn't communicated, I was particularly impressed by this film. It is always wonderful seeing original stories driven by talented directors receive the mainstream appeal they deserve. And it was personally very wonderful to be able to support these types of films by seeing it in theaters. Go watch it while you can.</p>`,

    fullReview: "<p>One of the major reasons modern romantic dramas where the guy and the girl don’t end up together are so devastating is because of the precedent set by <em>The Graduate</em>. We all want to experience a love so strong that it makes us abandon all reason pointing towards a safe and boring life and run headfirst into the unsure and exciting. We expect Mia and Sebastian of <em>La La Land</em> and Nora and Hae Sung of <em>Past Lives</em> to ditch their spouses and jump into the arms of their true loves like Ben and Elaine. So when that doesn’t happen in these post-<em>The Graduate</em> films, our hopes are dashed and our hearts are shattered. Any film with that degree of influence is commendable in my book.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that keeps this film so talked-about is how likable Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin Braddock is. He’s an awkward, disillusioned, and confused young adult with no romantic experience. And when he is thrust into a relationship with the considerably older Mrs. Robinson, he navigates the experience poorly with angry outbursts and a general misunderstanding of how to handle the situation. Yet all the while, we are endeared to the character because of how innocent these ineptitudes are. There was a time in all of our lives where we were just as tactful with the loves of our youth. Benjamin’s awkwardness comes across as relatable and adorable.</p>\n\n<p>Yet despite all the praise this film has received, I remained unconvinced by the central love story between Ben Braddock and Mrs. Robinson’s daughter, Elaine Robinson. The switch in the middle of the film from forbidden affair with the mother to precarious courting of the daughter felt quite jarring. While supposed to root for Elaine and Ben’s romance, I experienced no sense of attachment to the couple as we spent very little time with both of them. It is in this way, the shorter runtime hindered the film. As there were two female romantic interests we spent time with, a depth of feeling for the ultimate love story was lost.</p>\n\n<p>This was a major fault of the film for me. A romantic drama/coming-of-age film feels somewhat lackluster when the main romance doesn't elicit much emotion. And even the ending, which as discussed above impacted so many rom-coms and dramas afterward, felt unearned. Perhaps I’m being too harsh and am letting differences in rapidity of marriage between the 1960s and 2020s get in the way of my appreciation of the film, but truth be told, this was a major drawback in my viewing experience. This film mixed a bit of good and a bit of bad, but ultimately I’m not too upset about the cultural impact it has had throughout the years.</p>",

    fullReview: "<p>Another foray into the world of devastating romantic dramas. <em>In the Mood for Love</em> follows a young man and woman (both married but not to one another) in 1960s Hong Kong after they realize their spouses are having affairs. As neighbors finding themselves in similar situations, Su Li-Zhen and Chow Mo-Wan begin to spend time with one another, bonding over their frustrated confusion and eventually, of course, falling in love.</p>\n\n<p>The film finds profound depth by intentionally sidelining much of the context that kicks off the main events of the film. The deliberate choice is made to never allow the respective spouses of our main characters to appear on the screen. They are only made reference to in conversation and entirely omitted from phone calls with our protagonists—the details of these calls needing to be gleaned from one side of the discussion. The most important people in the protagonists’ lives are deemed unimportant by the film, which much prefers to focus on the emotional journey of Su Li-Zhen and Chow Mo-Wan. <em>In the Mood for Love</em> remains hyper-focused on the reactions to infidelity and the themes of finding love in tragedy, abandoning the “meatier” plot events of watching the affairs occur. In this way, it is able to fit such profound themes into such a short runtime.</p>\n\n<p>Another artistic choice that particularly caught my attention were the interspersed shots of slow motion. When the rhythmic strings of the film’s score start kicking in, you know exactly what is coming: a decelerated clip of Li-Zhen and Mo-Wan gazing at one another. While perhaps repetitious to some, I enjoyed the way each of these quick hiatuses reflected the stage of the two’s relationship at that point in the film—brief glances at the beginning, playful laughter later on, intense longing in the middle, and sincere sadness towards the end. And although it awkwardly interrupted the pacing at times, I respected how clear each of these clips were in conveying our young couple’s feelings.</p>",

    fullReview: "<p>An examination of the deep-rooted tradition of the samurai, <em>Harakiri</em> follows the poverty-stricken ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo as he ventures to the House of Iyi to commit harakiri—an honorable suicide by disembowelment. Yet as Tsugumo recounts his story to the Counselor of the House, it becomes clear that he is not all he claims to be. Though he outwardly embraces the samurai way, his faith in that tradition has been irrevocably shaken.</p>\n\n<p><em>Harakiri</em> masterfully combines stellar performances, breathtaking cinematography, and a complex yet compelling narrative into a work of art that, at its core, questions society’s blind reliance on tradition. Despite its technical brilliance, the film’s greatest achievement lies in its ability to provoke reflection on the role of ritual in our lives. While modern cultural traditions rarely reach the extremity of ritual suicide, the film encourages thoughtful viewers to consider how tradition shapes—and sometimes constrains—their worldview.</p>\n\n<p>The plot begins when an impoverished ronin approaches a renowned samurai house, requesting to end his life on their grounds. Moved by his apparent resolve, the house offers him employment and financial aid. Word of this generosity spreads, and other ronin attempt to exploit the samurai houses by making the same request, hoping for similar offers of assistance. In these precursory events, the film first exposes the absurdity of the tradition—not only that harakiri is encouraged, but that it must be performed under highly specific conditions, at designated houses. Such rigid formalism invites both exploitation and doubt in the sanctity of samurai culture, allowing hundreds of desperate ronin to profit from institutions supposedly built on honor.</p>\n\n<p>But if these events seem to warrant sympathy for the great houses of Japan, <em>Harakiri</em> quickly dispels it. Upon discovering the ronins’ true motives, many houses do not simply turn them away—they ruthlessly enforce the letter of the samurai code, compelling unwilling men to carry out their suicidal declarations. All the while, they publicly praise these coerced acts as displays of “resolve” and “commitment” to honor. These supposed icons of nobility weaponize tradition, using it as a convenient excuse to exert power and deliver fatal punishment.</p>\n\n<p>It is precisely this hollow valorization of tradition that pushes Tsugumo to confront the House of Iyi. After his son-in-law was forced to commit suicide while desperately seeking money to save his dying son, Tsugumo approaches the same house in the same way—as a final act of defiance. While the counselors of Iyi hope to entrap another dishonest ronin, Tsugumo instead recounts his son-in-law’s tragic story, laying bare the cruelty and blind devotion to ritual that led to his death.</p>\n\n<p>In this way, <em>Harakiri</em> offers a rare perspective: a samurai film that dares to critique the samurai code itself. Perhaps some dramatic ideals are necessary to preserve a philosophy, but the film argues that blind adherence to tradition—valuing it for its mere existence rather than its merit—is as senseless as forcing a man to die for appearances. In a world full of complexity and nuance, rigid “rules for life” ignore the individuality and richness of our personal experiences.</p>",
